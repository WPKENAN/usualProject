# Spam-Filter
Basic spam filter using two methods: Naive Bayes and Linear SVM.

Dataset:

Training and testing data are taken from the CSDMC2010 SPAM corpus, which is one of the datasets for the data mining
competition associated with ICONIP 2010.
It is slightly modified as the testing dataset used here was originally a part of the training dataset. The original testing dataset is not used as they do not have labels.
Read main_readme.txt for more information.

Requirements:

Python version 3.5+ and all the package requirements listed in requirements.txt
Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install them all.

Executing:

The script has default settings which enables it to run without user input. You can get more information in NBreadme.txt and SVMreadme.txt.

NB.py

You can learn more about the algorithm implemented here: http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6467

SVM.py

I would suggest looking up count vectorizer as it is the only feature being used: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html
