# The UNSW-NB15 data set

Implementation of a basic deep neural network for network packet classification using Tensorflow.

Link to description of dataset: https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/australian-centre-for-cyber-security/cybersecurity/ADFA-NB15-Datasets/

The code can be seen as a learning example on how to build a neural network using **Tensorflow** while preprocessing data with **Pandas** and **Numpy**.
