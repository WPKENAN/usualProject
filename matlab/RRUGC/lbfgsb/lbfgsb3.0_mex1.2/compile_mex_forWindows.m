Extra installation script for Windows, assuming you do not have
a Fortran compiler.

The lbfgsb package is in Fortran, and compiling Fortran on Windows
is not fun nor easy. So I have used the "f2c" utility to convert
the Fortran files to C files. The only problem is that "f2c" relies
on its own libraries, which are a little tricky to get working.
You can download precompiled f2c libraries (e.g. "libf2c.lib") from the
web, but these have been compiled with specific compilers. If your Matlab
compiler doesn't match those versions, then you might have issues.

So, this script compiles the f2c library from scratch. The lbfgsb C files
might not need the entire library, so my approach is to include the entire
library and then exclude files that cause problems. So far, it seems
to work.

If compilation fails, add "-v" flags to the mex scripts and you will
get more verbose and useful output.

% that running this file will crash Matlab.

%% Step 0: run mex -setup if you haven't already.
% This tells Matlab which compiler to use

%   32-bit Matlab on Windows comes with the lcc-win32 compiler, which is
%   what I tested this with.

%   64-bit Matlab doesn't come with a compiler, but you can get a free
%   Microsoft C compiler; see
%   http://www.mathworks.com/support/compilers/R2011b/win64.html

%% Step 1, new and improved (for Windows users):
%   Download the f2c version of lbfgsb v3.0
%   I have converted this from Fortran to C using f2c, and made a few small
%   changes by hand. It depends on the f2c libraries, which we will
%   deal with shortly.
